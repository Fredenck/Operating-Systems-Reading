This document introduces the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Originally developed by Netscape, SSL has been universally accepted on the World Wide Web for authenticated and encrypted communication between clients and servers.</A></P>

<A NAME="1043326">
The new Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard called Transport Layer Security (TLS) is based on SSL. This was recently published as an IETF Internet-Draft, <A HREF="ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-protocol-05.txt" TARGET="_top">The TLS Protocol Version 1.0</A>. Netscape products will fully support TLS.</A></P>
<A NAME="1042227">
This document is primarily intended for administrators of Netscape server products, but the information it contains may also be useful for developers of applications that support SSL. The document assumes that you are familiar with the basic concepts of public-key cryptography, as summarized in the companion document <A HREF="pubkey.html" TARGET="_top">Introduction to Public-Key Cryptography</A>.</A></P>

<H2><A NAME="The SSL Protocol"></A>
<A NAME="1041986">
 The SSL Protocol
</A></H2><A NAME="1043392">
The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) governs the transport and routing of data over the Internet. Other protocols, such as the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), or Internet Messaging Access Protocol (IMAP), run "on top of" TCP/IP in the sense that they all use TCP/IP to support typical application tasks such as displaying web pages or running email servers.</A></P>
<P><A NAME="1045182">
<B>Figure 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  SSL runs above TCP/IP and below high-level application protocols<P>

</B></A></P>


<A NAME="1045818">
The SSL protocol runs above TCP/IP and below higher-level protocols such as HTTP or IMAP. It uses TCP/IP on behalf of the higher-level protocols, and in the process allows an SSL-enabled server to authenticate itself to an SSL-enabled client, allows the client to authenticate itself to the server, and allows both machines to establish an encrypted connection.</A></P>
<A NAME="1043523">
These capabilities address fundamental concerns about communication over the Internet and other TCP/IP networks:</A></P>
<ul><P><LI><A NAME="1043310">
<B>SSL server authentication</B> allows a user to confirm a server's identity. SSL-enabled client software can use standard techniques of public-key cryptography to check that a server's certificate and public ID are valid and have been issued by a certificate authority (CA) listed in the client's list of trusted CAs. This confirmation might be important if the user, for example, is sending a credit card number over the network and wants to check the receiving server's identity.</A></LI>
<P><LI><A NAME="1043315">
<B>SSL client authentication</B> allows a server to confirm a user's identity. Using the same techniques as those used for server authentication, SSL-enabled server software can check that a client's certificate and public ID are valid and have been issued by a certificate authority (CA) listed in the server's list of trusted CAs. This confirmation might be important if the server, for example, is a bank sending confidential financial information to a customer and wants to check the recipient's identity.</A></LI>
<P><LI><A NAME="1043697">
<B>An encrypted SSL connection</B> requires all information sent between a client and a server to be encrypted by the sending software and decrypted by the receiving software, thus providing a high degree of confidentiality. Confidentiality is important for both parties to any private transaction. In addition, all data sent over an encrypted SSL connection is protected with a mechanism for detecting tampering--that is, for automatically determining whether the data has been altered in transit. </A></LI>
</ul><A NAME="1043218">
The SSL protocol includes two sub-protocols: the SSL record protocol and the SSL handshake protocol. The SSL record protocol defines the format used to transmit data. The SSL handshake protocol involves using the SSL record protocol to exchange a series of messages between an SSL-enabled server and an SSL-enabled client when they first establish an SSL connection. This exchange of messages is designed to facilitate the following actions:</A></P>
<ul><P><LI><A NAME="1043219">
Authenticate the server to the client.</A></LI>
<P><LI><A NAME="1043220">
Allow the client and server to select the cryptographic algorithms, or ciphers, that they both support.</A></LI>
<P><LI><A NAME="1043221">
Optionally authenticate the client to the server.</A></LI>
<P><LI><A NAME="1043222">
Use public-key encryption techniques to generate shared secrets.</A></LI>
<P><LI><A NAME="1043223">
Establish an encrypted SSL connection.</A></LI>

<A NAME="1046262">
The SSL protocol supports the use of a variety of different cryptographic algorithms, or <B>ciphers,</B> for use in operations such as authenticating the server and client to each other, transmitting certificates, and establishing session keys. Clients and servers may support different <B>cipher suites,</B> or sets of ciphers, depending on factors such as the version of SSL they support, company policies regarding acceptable encryption strength, and government restrictions on export of SSL-enabled software.<B> </B>Among its other functions, the SSL handshake protocol determines how the server and client negotiate which cipher suites they will use to authenticate each other, to transmit certificates, and to establish session keys. </A></P>

Key-exchange algorithms like KEA and RSA key exchange govern the way in which the server and client determine the symmetric keys they will both use during an SSL session. The most commonly used SSL cipher suites use RSA key exchange.</A></P>
<A NAME="1050507">
The SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 protocols support overlapping sets of cipher suites. Administrators can enable or disable any of the supported cipher suites for both clients and servers. When a particular client and server exchange information during the SSL handshake, they identify the strongest enabled cipher suites they have in common and use those for the SSL session.</A></P>
<A NAME="1048787">
Decisions about which cipher suites a particular organization decides to enable depend on trade-offs among the sensitivity of the data involved, the speed of the cipher, and the applicability of export rules.</A></P>
<A NAME="1048393">
Some organizations may want to disable the weaker ciphers to prevent SSL connections with weaker encryption. However, due to U.S. government restrictions on products that support anything stronger than 40-bit encryption, disabling support for all 40-bit ciphers effectively restricts access to network browsers that are available only in the United States (unless the server involved has a special Global Server ID that permits the international client to "step up" to stronger encryption). For more information about U.S. export restrictions, see <A HREF="http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/security/exprt/index.html" TARGET="_top">Export Restrictions on International Sales</A>. </A></P>
<A NAME="1050408">
To serve the largest possible range of users, it's administrators may wish to enable as broad a range of SSL cipher suites as possible. That way, when a domestic client or server is dealing with another domestic server or client, respectively, it will negotiate the use of the strongest ciphers available. And when an domestic client or server is dealing with an international server or client, it will negotiate the use of those ciphers that are permitted under U.S. export regulations.</A></P>
<A NAME="1050917">
However, since 40-bit ciphers can be broken relatively quickly, administrators who are concerned about eavesdropping and whose user communities can legally use stronger ciphers should disable the 40-bit ciphers.</A></P>

 The SSL Handshake
</A></H2><A NAME="1047107">
The SSL protocol uses a combination of public-key and symmetric key encryption. Symmetric key encryption is much faster than public-key encryption, but public-key encryption provides better authentication techniques. An SSL session always begins with an exchange of messages called the <B>SSL handshake. </B>The handshake allows the server to authenticate itself to the client using public-key techniques, then allows the client and the server to cooperate in the creation of symmetric keys used for rapid encryption, decryption, and tamper detection during the session that follows. Optionally, the handshake also allows the client to authenticate itself to the server.</A></P>

The exact programmatic details of the messages exchanged during the SSL handshake are beyond the scope of this document.

The client uses some of the information sent by the server to authenticate the server (see <A HREF="ssl.html#1041643">Server Authentication</A> for details).

<P><LI><A NAME="1045617">
<B>Is the issuing CA a trusted CA?</B> Each SSL-enabled client maintains a list of trusted CA certificates, represented by the shaded area on the right side of <A HREF="ssl.html#1045936">Figure 2</A>. This list determines which server certificates the client will accept. If the distinguished name (DN) of the issuing CA matches the DN of a CA on the client's list of trusted CAs, the answer to this question is yes, and the client goes on to <A HREF="ssl.html#1047645">Step&nbsp;3</A>. If the issuing CA is not on the list, the server will not be authenticated unless the client can verify a certificate chain ending in a CA that is on the list (see <A HREF="pubkey.html?content=ssl.html#1050537" TARGET="_top">CA Hierarchies</A> for details). </A></LI>
<P><LI><A NAME="1047645">
<B>Does the issuing CA's public key validate the issuer's digital signature?</B> The client uses the public key from the CA's certificate (which it found in its list of trusted CAs in step 2) to validate the CA's digital signature on the server certificate being presented. If the information in the server certificate has changed since it was signed by the CA or if the CA certificate's public key doesn't correspond to the private key used by the CA to sign the server certificate, the client won't authenticate the server's identity. If the CA's digital signature can be validated, the server treats the user's certificate as a valid "letter of introduction" from that CA and proceeds. At this point, the client has determined that the server certificate is valid. It is the client's responsibility to take <A HREF="ssl.html#1050624">Step&nbsp;4</A> before <A HREF="ssl.html#1045623">Step&nbsp;5</A>.</A></LI>
<P><LI><A NAME="1050624">
<B>Does the domain name in the server's certificate match the domain name of the server itself?</B> This step confirms that the server is actually located at the same network address specified by the domain name in the server certificate. Although step 4 is not technically part of the SSL protocol, it provides the only protection against a form of security attack known as a <A HREF="ssl.html#1050889">Man-in-the-Middle Attack</A>. Clients must perform this step and must refuse to authenticate the server or establish a connection if the domain names don't match. If the server's actual domain name matches the domain name in the server certificate, the client goes on to <A HREF="ssl.html#1045623">Step&nbsp;5</A>.</A></LI>
<P><LI><A NAME="1045623">
<B>The server is authenticated.</B> The client proceeds with the SSL handshake. If the client doesn't get to step 5 for any reason, the server identified by the certificate cannot be authenticated, and the user will be warned of the problem and informed that an encrypted and authenticated connection cannot be established. If the server requires client authentication, the server performs the steps described in <A HREF="ssl.html#1050729">Client Authentication</A>.</A></LI>

After the steps described here, the server must successfully use its private key to decrypt the premaster secret the client sends in <A HREF="ssl.html#1045841">Step&nbsp;4</A> of <A HREF="ssl.html#1041640">The SSL Handshake</A>. Otherwise, the SSL session will be terminated. This provides additional assurance that the identity associated with the public key in the server's certificate is in fact the server with which the client is connected. </A></P>

 Man-in-the-Middle Attack
</A></H4>

<A NAME="1050727">
As suggested in <A HREF="ssl.html#1050624">Step&nbsp;4</A> above, the client application must check the server domain name specified in the server certificate against the actual domain name of the server with which the client is attempting to communicate. This step is necessary to protect against a man-in the middle attack, which works as follows. </A></P>
<A NAME="1050886">
The "man in the middle" is a rogue program that intercepts all communication between the client and a server with which the client is attempting to communicate via SSL. The rogue program intercepts the legitimate keys that are passed back and forth during the SSL handshake, substitutes its own, and makes it appear to the client that it is the server, and to the server that it is the client. </A></P>
<A NAME="1050812">
The encrypted information exchanged at the beginning of the SSL handshake is actually encrypted with the rogue program's public key or private key, rather than the client's or server's real keys. The rogue program ends up establishing one set of session keys for use with the real server, and a different set of session keys for use with the client. This allows the rogue program not only to read all the data that flows between the client and the real server, but also to change the data without being detected. Therefore, it is extremely important for the client to check that the domain name in the server certificate corresponds to the domain name of the server with which a client is attempting to communicate--in addition to checking the validity of the certificate by performing the other steps described in <A HREF="ssl.html#1041643">Server Authentication</A>.</A></P>

 Client Authentication
</A></H3>

<A NAME="1039952">
SSL-enabled servers can be configured to require client authentication, or cryptographic validation by the server of the client's identity. When a server configured this way requests client authentication (see <A HREF="ssl.html#1049927">Step&nbsp;6</A> of <A HREF="ssl.html#1041640">The SSL Handshake</A>), the client sends the server both a certificate and a separate piece of digitally signed data to authenticate itself. The server uses the digitally signed data to validate the public key in the certificate and to authenticate the identity the certificate claims to represent.</A></P>
<A NAME="1045465">
The SSL protocol requires the client to create a digital signature by creating a one-way hash from data generated randomly during the handshake and known only to the client and server. The hash of the data is then encrypted with the private key that corresponds to the public key in the certificate being presented to the server. </A></P>
<A NAME="1039954">
To authenticate the binding between the public key and the person or other entity identified by the certificate that contains the public key, an SSL-enabled server must receive a "yes" answer to the first four questions shown in <A HREF="ssl.html#1039962">Figure 3</A>. Although the fifth question is not part of the SSL protocol, Netscape servers can be configured to support this requirement to take advantage of the user's entry in an LDAP directory as part of the authentication process.</A></P>
