<H2>1. Introduction</h2>
<P>
Given a pencil and a piece of paper, it is simple to draw a
dependency graph that demonstrates the existence of a deadlock.  
In the real world, it is much more complicated.
<ul>
	<li>How do we know when to initiate our (likely quite expensive)
	enumeration of all processes and resources?</li>
	<li>If a process blocks trying to get access to a system resource 
	(e.g. a file or semaphore), we can know what resource the
	process is trying to obtain, and perhaps even who the current
	owner is.  </li>
	<li>If a process blocks to await a message that has
	not been sent, or because it is waiting for a large region of
	memory to come free it may be much more difficult to determine
	which process is responsible for failing to release the required
	resource. </li>
	<li>In a distributed system, many of the actors (and their
	resources and resource needs) may be outside of our 
	ability to examine them, if they are even known to us. </li>
	<li>Even if we could determine the identities of all participating
	processes and resources (to show the presence of a deadlock),
	what would we do to correct it?  Kill them all and hope
	that it doesn't happen again?</li>
</ul>
These are only a few (among the many) reasons that deadlock
detection has not been embraced by many real systems.
But there is another situation ...
<ul>
   <li>	where computation does not progress as expected,</li>
   <li> involving a circular set of resource dependencies,</li>
   <li> whose possibility is immediately obvious, and can be
   	confirmed by a very inexpensive analysis,</li>
   <li> which, once identified, can be easily, promptly 
   	and effectively corrected</li>
</ul>
This is worthy of study, both as practical problem that arrises in real systems, 
and as an example of the complexity of ensuring <em>Quality of Service</em>.

<h2>2. Priority Inversion</h2>
<P>
A high priority process should be run before lower priority processes,
and may even have the ability to preempt them.  But what if, at the
time when the high priority process wants to run, a low priority 
process happens to own a resource (e.g. a mutex) that the high priority
process needs.  The high priority process will block.  Priority 
doesn't mean much if you aren't runnable.
</p>
<P>
Well, after the high priority process blocks, then the low priority
process can continue running, and release the needed resource, 
at which point the high priority process will un-block and run.
Right?  Probably, unless there are other processes in the system
that out-rank the low priority process ... which may have to
wait a very long time before it gets a chance to run.
</p>
<p>
When a high priority process blocks for a resource held by a
lower priority process, the high priority process effectively
becomes a low priority process, who cannot run until after
the low priority process completes.
</P>
<P>
This is called <em>priority inversion</em>.
</p>

<h2>3. How we Detect it?</h2>
<P>
If we are strictly concerned with priority inversion associated with locks,
it is very easy to detect:
<pre><tt>
	if (lock is available)
		all is right with the world
	elif (lock->owner->priority < myproc->priority)
		we have priority inversion
	fi
</tt></pre>
</p>
<ul>
	It is obvious when we should perform this check ... when we fail to get a lock.<br>
	It is obvious what resource we should examine ... the lock we just failed to get.<br>
	It is obvious which process to examine ... the one who currently owns that lock.<br>
	It is obvious whether or not we have priority inversion ... my priority is better than 
	that of the current lock owner.
</ul>
<P>
If you look at mutex implementations, you will see that many of them include a field
to track the current holder of the lock.  One of the reasons for tracking this information
is to enable us to detect (and manage) priority inversion.
</P>

<h2>4. What can we do about it?</h2>
<P>
If I am waiting for a lock that is owned by a lower priority process, I have
effectively been demoted to that lower priority.  The solution is to temporarily
<em>brevet</em> the resource owner up to my own priority level ... so that it will
be scheduled as if it had my priority ... and I am no longer waiting for a lower
priority process to complete.
But as soon as that process releases the lock, it will be restored to its 
normal priority, allowing me to preempt it.
</p>

<h2>5. Conclusions</h2>
<p>
Priority Inversion can happen whenever processes (or threads) of different priority
share a serialized resource.  In the collisions are rare, and the lower priority
process runs (and completes) soon enough, the problem may go unnoticed.
But eventually, a situation will arrise wherein the imposed delays cause
externally observable problems.  It is often the case with timing errors
that they happen regularly, but are only discovered when the consequences
are serious enough to be noticed.   If we know that a certain computation
will have a very high priority, we should carefully examine all of the
resources it requires to make sure that we are not creating an opportunity
for priority inversion.
</p>
<P>
Another interesting conclusion we can draw from this is that the execution
speed of a process is not merely a function of scheduling priority.
If a high priority process spends most of its time waiting for 
completions (locks, messages, memory allocation, file I/O, ...)
we may find that scheduling priority has only a small effect on
processing speed.  If it is important that a process execute
quickly, it is important that all service requests made by that
process be satisfied quickly.  This is why <em>quality of service</em>
is often referred to as an <em>end-to-end</em> problem;
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and 
high priority processes must receive expedited handling 
for all of the services they require.
