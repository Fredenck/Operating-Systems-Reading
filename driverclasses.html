<H2>Introduction</h2>
<P>
Device drivers represent both:
<ul><dl>
   <dt>generalizing abstractions</dt>
	<P>
   	<dd>	gathering a myriad of very different devices together
		and synthesizing a few general classes 
		(e.g. disks, network interfaces, graphics adaptors)
		and standard models, behaviors and interfaces to 
		be implemented by all drivers for a given class.</dd>
   	</p>
   <dt>simplifying abstractions</dt>
	<P>
	<dd>	providing an implemention of standard class interfaces
		while opaquely encapsulating the details of how to
		effectively and efficiently use a particular
		device.</dd>
	</p>
</dl></ul>
</p>
<P>
For reasons of performance and control, Operating Systems tend not to be 
implemented in object oriented languages (does anybody remember JavaOS?).
Yet despite being implemented in simpler langauges (often C), Operating
Systems, in device drivers, offer highly evolved examples of a different
realization of class interfaces, derivation, and inheritance.
</P>
<P>
Whether we are talking about storage, networking, video, or human-interface,
the number of available devices is huge and growing.  The number and diversity
of these devices creates tremendous demands for object oriented code reuse:
<ul>
   <li> We want the system to behave similarly, no matter
        what the underlying devices were being used to provide
	storage, networking, etc.  To ensure this, we would like
	most of the higher level functionality to be implemented
	in common, higher level modules.</li>
   <li> We would like to minimize the cost of developing drivers
    	to support new devices.  This is most easily done if the
	majority of the functionality is implemented in common
	code that can be inherrited by the individual drivers.</li>
   <li> As system functionality and performance are improved, we
   	would like to ensure that those benefits accrue not only
	to new device drivers, but also to older device drivers.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
These needs can be satisfied by implementing the higher level
functionality (associated with each general class of device)
in common code that uses per-device implementations of 
a standard sub-class driver to operate over a particular device.
This requires:
<ul>
   <li>	deriving device-driver sub-classes for each of the
        major classes of device.</li>
   <li>	defining sub-class specific interfaces to be implemented
        by the drivers for all devices in each of those classes.</li>
   <li>	creating per-device implementations of those standard
   	sub-class interfaces.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<H2>Major Driver Classes</h2>
<P>
In the earliest versions of Unix, all devices were divided into
two fundamental classes, which are still present in all Unix
derivatives:
<dl>
    <dt>block devices</dt>
    <dd>
    	<P>
	These are random-access devices, addressable in
	fixed size (e.g. 512 byte, 4K byte) blocks.
    	Their drivers implement a <em>request</em> method to
	enqueue asynchronous DMA requests.
	The request descriptor included information about
	the desired operation
	(e.g. byte count, target device, disk address and 
	in-memory buffer address) as well as completion 
	information (how much data was
	transferred, error indications) and a condition
	variable the requestor could use to await the
	eventual completion of the request.
    	</p>
    	<p>
	A read or write request could be issued for any number
	of blocks, but in most cases a large request would be broken
	into multiple single-block requests, each of which would
	be passed, block at a time, through the system buffer cache.
	For this reason block device drivers also implement a
	<em>fsync</em> method to flush out any buffered writes.
    	</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>character devices</dt>
    <P>
    <dd>
	<P>
    	These devices may be sequential access, or may be
	byte-addressable.  They support the standard
	synchronous
	<em>read(2)</em>, <em>write(2)</em> and (indirectly)
	<em>seek(2)</em> operations.
    	</P>
	<P>
	For devices that supported DMA, read and write 
	operations were expected to be done as a single
	(potentially very large) DMA transfer between the
	device and the buffers in user address space.
	</P>
    </dd>
    </p>
</dl>
<P>
A key point here is that, even in the oldest Unix systems,
device drivers were divided into distinct classes (implementing
different interfaces) based on the needs of distinct classes
of clients:
<ul>
   <li> Block devices were designed to be used, within the operating
	system, by file systems, to access disks.  Forcing all I/O
	to go through the system buffer cache is almost surely the
	right thing to do with file system I/O.
	</li>
   <li>	Character devices were designed to be used directly by 
   	applications.  The potential for large DMA transfers
	directly between the device and user-space buffers
	meant that character (or <em>raw</em>) I/O operations
	might be much more efficient than the corresponding
	requests to a block device.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<P>
These two major classes of device were not mutually exclusive.
A single driver could export both block and character interfaces.
A file system would be mounted on top of the block device, while
back-up and integrity-checking software might access the disk 
through its (potentially much more efficient) character device*.
All device drivers support <em>initialize</em> and <em>cleanup</em>
methods (for dynamic module loading and unloading), 
<em>open</em> and <em>release</em> methods (roughly corresponding
to the <em>open(2)</em> and <em>close(2)</em> system calls),
and an optional catch-all <em>ioctl(2)</em> method.
</p>

*In more contemporary systems, it is possible for a client to specify
that block I/O should not be passed through the system buffer cache.
</p>
<H2>Driver sub-classes</h2>
<P>
Given the fundamental importance of file systems and disks to operating
systems, it is not surprising that block device drivers would have been
singled out as a special sub-class in even the earliest versions of 
Unix.  But as system functionality evolved, the operating system
began to implement higher level services for other sub-classes of
devices:
<UL>
   <li> input editing and outut translation for terminals and virtual terminals</li>
   <li> address binding and packet sending/receipt for network interfaces</li>
   <li> display mapping and window management for graphics adaptors</li>
   <li> character-set mapping for keyboards</li>
   <li> cursor positioning for pointing devices</li>
   <li> sample mixing, volume and equalization for sound devices</li>
</UL>
</P>
<center>
<img src="driver_clients.jpg" height="400">
</center>
<P>
And as each of these sub-systems evolved, new device driver methods*
were defined to enable more effective communication between the 
higher level frameworks and the lower level device drivers in each
sub-class.  Each of these sub-class specific interfaces is referred
to as a <em>Device Driver Interface</em> (DDI).
</p>
<center>
<img src="driver_sub_ddi.jpg" height="400">
</center>
<P>
*It should be noted that in some cases, the higher frameworks have
been implemented in user-mode, so that some of the new interfaces
have been specified as behavior rather than new methods.
</P>
<P>
The rewards for this structure are:
<ul>
   <li> Sub-class drivers become easier to implement because so much
   	of the important functionality is implemented in higher level
	software.</li>
   <li> The system behaves identically over a wide range of different
   	devices.</li>
   <li> Most functionality enhancements to will be in the higher
   	level code, and so should automatically work on all devices
	within that sub-class.</li>
</ul>
<p>
But the price for these rewards is that all device drivers must implement
exactly the same interfaces:
<ul>
   <li> if a driver does not (correctly) implement the standard interfaces
   	for its device sub-class, it will not work with the higher level
	software.</li>
   <li>	if a driver implements additional functionality (not defined in
   	the standard interfaces for its device sub-class), those features
	will not be exploited by the standard higher level software.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Services for Device Drivers</h2>
<P>
It is nearly impossible to implement a completely self-contained device
driver.  Most device drivers are likely to require a range of resources
and services from the operating system:
<ul>
   <li> dynamic memory allocation </li>
   <li> I/O and bus resource allocation and management</li>
   <li> condition variable operations (wait and signal) </li>
   <li> mutual exclusion </li>
   <li> control of, and being called to service interrupts </li>
   <li> DMA target pin/release, scatter/gather map management </li>
   <li> configuration/registry services</li>
</ul>
The collection of services, exposed by the operating system for
use by device drivers is sometimes referred to as the
<em>Driver-Kernel Interface</em> (DKI).
Interface stability for DKI functions is every bit as important as it is
for the DDI entry points.  If an operating system eliminates or incompatibly
changes a DKI function, device drivers that depend on that function may
cease working.  The requirement to maintain stable DKI entry points may 
greatly constrain our ability to evolve our operating system implementation.
Similar issues arrise for other classes of dynamically loadable kernel
modules (such as network protocols and file systems).
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<P>
Device drivers demonstrate an evolution from a basic super-class (character
devices) into an ever-expanding hierarchy of derived sub-classes.  But unlike
traditional class derivation, where sub-class implementations inherit most of
their implemntation from their parent, we see a different sort of inheritance.
While each new sub-class and instance is likely to be a new implementation,
what they inherit is pre-existing higher level frameworks that do 
do most of their work for them.
