<H4>1. Introduction</H4>
<P>
An indexed sequential file is comprised of a sequence of 
records, each of which has one or more unique keys.  
Records can be read sequentially, 
but it is also possible to seek directly to any desired 
record by its key value.  
The <strong>indexed</strong>
part of the name comes from the fact that the system 
maintains an <strong>index</strong> that can be consulted
(much like an index in a book)
to find the record number, in the file, associated with
a particular key.  
<P>
IBM's core business has been "Enterprise Servers" and
commercial databases since long before anybody even knew 
what an Enterprise Server was.  Today, when we talk about
databases, most people think of relational databases 
(which can be searched based on complex queries).  
Historically, however, most business databases have been
indexed sequential files.   IBM has been a late-adaptor in
many Operating System technologies ... but they have always
been the Market Leaders in indexed sequential file support.
<P>
IBM's flagship Indexed Sequential File product is VSAM.
We will study it in this class because:
<UL>
	<LI> it is a good illustration of both the key problems
	     in indexed sequential files, and how they can be
	     solved.
	<LI> it has a very rich feature set, and is in fact
	     the standard against which other products are
	     judged.
	<LI> many of you are likely to encounter it in your
	     careers.
</UL>


<H4>2. Features of Indexed Sequential Files</H4>
<P>
With ordinary sequential files, people expect to be able to read
the file efficiently (which means a small number of large transfers,
with minimal head movement).  With indexed sequential files we have
a few additional expectations:
<UL>
	<LI>
	To be able to locate a given record, based on its key,
	and fetch it with minimal I/O (ideally a single read).
	<LI>
	To be able to insert new records into an existing file,
	with minimal impact on the average access time for 
	both sequential and indexed access.
	<LI>
	To be able to delete records from a file with minimal
	impact on the average access time for both sequential
	and indexed access.
	<LI>
	When the database is read sequentially, records are
	returned in key order (rather than the order in which
	they were added to the database).
	<LI>
	To be able to grow databases to very large numbers of 
	records, again with minimal impact on the average access
	time for both sequential and indexed access.
</UL>
<P>
The first thing we think of with indexed sequential files is
the index ... but it often turns out that efficient insertion,
and scalable growth are probably the most difficult problems.

There are, however, a great many secondary features that the
customers of Indexed Sequential files often demand:
<UL>
	<LI>
	In addition to the primary key (which orders records
	within the database) records can also have additional
	secondary keys.  Records can be fetched on the basis
	of any of their keys.
	<LI>
	Records can be either fixed length or variable length.
	VSAM even supports extremely long (i.e. multi-track) records.
	<LI>
	In addition to being able to locate records based on
	key values, it is also possible to seek to records by:
	<UL>
		<LI> record number within the file
		<LI> relative byte address within the file
	</UL>
</UL>

<P>
<H4>3. Structural Overview</H4>
<P>
Like all MVS files, VSAM files are comprised of multiple 
<strong>extents</strong>, each extent being a fairly large
chunk of contiguous space.  In VSAM each of the contiguous
extents is called a <strong>Control Area</strong> 
(or <strong>CA</strong>). 
<P>
<h4>Control Areas</h4>
<P>
The Control Area is the unit of space allocation, and when there
is no more room in an existing Control Area, a new Control Area
is added to the data set.
<P>
Each Control Area is divided up into multiple 
<strong>Control Intervals</strong> (or <strong>CI</strong>s).
Each Control Interval contains multiple records, but we will
always read or write an entire Control Interval at a time.
Thus, the Control Interval is the unit of I/O.
<P>
Control Areas are generally made up of tracks in a single cylinder, 
which means that all of the Control Intervals within a Control
Area are likely to reside in a single cylinder.  This means
that seeking from one Control Interval to another (within a 
Control Area) generally involves no head motion.  VSAM will
take advantage of this to implement efficient record insertion.
<P>

<h4>Control Intervals</h4>
<P>
A Control Interval can contain many records.  If the records are 
not all of constant length, the number of records in each CI
will also vary.  Also, as we will see when we discuss record
insertion, all CIs are created with a moderate amount of free
space (to leave room for newly inserted records).
<P>
All of the records in a CI (along with their keys) are packed 
at the beginning of the CI.  At the end of each CI is a descriptor
(including a record length) for each record in the CI.  The area
between the records and their descriptors is free space ... to 
accommodate new records.
<P>
<CENTER>

<P>
<H4>VSAM Indices</h4>
<P>
The "key" to random access is an index.  
All VSAM files have at least one primary index (for the primary key).
If records have multiple keys, there may be multiple indices
(one for each key).
<P>
A VSAM index contains one entry for each active Control Interval.
The entries are sorted in key order, and each entry contains:
<UL>
	<LI> The address of the Control Interval.
	<LI> The highest key value found in that Control Interval.
</UL>
This requires only a few bytes of information per track. 
This means that VSAM indices tend to be very small, can be
kept in memory, and can be searched very quickly.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG src="vsamix.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
Note that keys may be sparse (e.g. the existence of records with keys
A104JM326 and A104JM328 does not imply there is a record A104JM327).
If the index says that CI #124 contains records up to A104JL300 and
that CI #125 contains records up to A104JM400, we can infer that
if there is a record A104JM327, it should be found in CI #125.  If
we look in CI #125 and do not find it, we can safely infer that
there is no such record in the file.
<P>

<H4>4. Finding a Desired Record</h4>
<P>
To find a desired record we must search the Index to find the
first Control Interval that contains a key greater than or 
equal to the one we want.  Because the index is made up of
fixed-sized entries, we can do a binary search to find the
desired entry very quickly.
<P>
Once we find the appropriate index entry, it will point us to the
Control Interval that <strong>should</strong> contain the record
we want.  We can then read in that CI, and search it for the
desired record.
<P>
The records, within the Control Interval, are in key-order, so
we can stop our search as soon as we find either the key we want
or a key value higher than the one we want.  In the latter case
we can infer that the requested record does not (yet) exist.
<P>
If we keep the index in memory, this entire operation can be
done with one disk reads, and two quick in-memory searches.  This
satisfies our goal of efficient random-access.
<P>

<H4>5. Record Insertion</h4>
<P>
When we insert a new record into the file, our primary goal is
to insure that any changes we make to the file organization do
not significantly slow down sequential or random-access processing.
Our secondary goal is to minimize the time and I/O required to
perform the insertion.  VSAM uses the CA/CI organization to
help it achieve both of these goals.
<P>
In the simplest case, we read in the appropriate Control Interval,
and insert the new record into it (shifting higher-keyed records
forward into the free-space), and then write the Control Interval
back out to disk again.  One read, and one write.
<P>
What if there is insufficient room, in that Control Interval, for
the new record?  In this case we find an unallocated Control Interval
in the same Control Area, and we then move half of the records in
the current (full) Control Interval into the new one.  After this,
each of the two Control Intervals will be only half-full, and there
should be ample room for inserting the desired record into the
appropriate CI.  This requires one read and two writes to update
the CIs ... and we will also have to update the index (to know
about the new Control Interval).   After this overflow, it will
take one extra read to process the database (to read the new
Control Interval) but (because the new CI is in the same cylinder
as the old one) there should be no additional head motion.
<P>
What if there are no free CIs left in the current CA?  This is
a bigger problem.  In this case, we allocate a whole new extent
to the file and create it as a new Control Area.  We then take
half of the Control Intervals in the current (full) CA (e.g.
the lowest keyed half), and move them into the new CA.  Once
this is done, there will be ample free CIs in both CAs, and
it should be a long time before another such overflow occurs.
CA overflow involves a lot of I/O, followed by a lot of index 
updating.  Note, however, that CIs for closely related keys are
still in the same CA, so there will not be much additional 
head motion when processing the file sequentially.
<P>


<H4>6. Sequential File Access</h4>
<P>
To process the file sequentially, we merely read in the Control Intervals,
in the order in which they are listed in the index.  If there have been
many insertions and overflows, there may be considerable seeking back
and forth between Control Intervals.
Seeking back and forth between Control Intervals may involve some
rotational latency delays, but will not involve any head motion
(because all CIs in a CA are usually in the same cylinder).
After processing
all of the Control Intervals within one Control Area, we will have to 
reposition the heads to access the next Control Area, but there will
be no further head motion until we have processed all of its Control Intervals.
<P>
Thus, even after numerous insertions and overflows, we are still able
to sequentially read the entire file in large reads (one CI or track
at a time) and with minimal head movement.  This satisfies our goal
of efficient sequential access.
<P>

<H4>7. VSAM Free Space Management</h4>
<P>
The CA/CI structure of VSAM makes it possible to handle insertion
overflows with minimal head motion ... but any time we overflow a
CI we will have to do extra I/O (to a new CI).  The I/O associated
with overflowing a CA is horrendous ... but fortunately this doesn't
happen very often.  The way to minimize this extra I/O is to 
minimize insertion overflows:
<UL>
	<LI> Don't fill up the Control Intervals.  
	Leave free space in each CI to accommodate new record
	insertions without overflowing into another CI.
	<LI> Don't fill up the Control Areas.
	Leave several unallocated Control Intervals in each
	Control Area, so that when a CI does overflow, we can
	find overflow space in the same Control Area, and avoid
	having to allocate and overflow into a new Control Area.
</UL>
<P>
Leaving empty space in each Control Interval reduces I/O efficiency.
If 20 records would fit in a track, but we decide to leave 50% free
space in each Control Interval, we would double the number of tracks
we have to read in order to process the database.
Leaving unallocated Control Intervals in a Control Area further
increases the disk space required to hold our database.
<P>
Thus there is tradeoff to be made between the database size, 
sequential processing time, and the efficiency of new record 
insertions.  If we leave very little free space in the database,
it will be smaller and faster to process sequentially, but it
will experience many expensive insertion overflows.  If we leave
a great deal of free space we can greatly reduce the number of
insertion overflows, but we will pay for it in greatly increased
disk space and sequential processing time.  TANSTAAFL!
<P>
Data base administrators have to weigh these trade-offs, and decide
what the optimum free space margin is, given their expectations for
database size, growth, and processing.
<P>
We can create a database with nicely distributed free-space, and
well allocated Control Intervals ... but after a few million record
insertions and deletions the free space distribution will not be
as good, and processing time will steadily increase.  For this
reason, VSAM database administrators periodically recreate their
databases ... writing out all the records to tape, and then reading
them back into a brand-new database, with well distributed free space.  
This has many of the same
advantages as defragmentation in FAT file systems.
<P>

<H4>8. Summary</h4>
<P>
For many years IBMs <strong>Indexed Sequential Access Method</strong>
(<strong>ISAM</strong>) was the industry standard for databases.  Its
successor (<strong>VSAM</strong>) remains a strong force in the market,
even after the advent of more sophisticated relational databases.
<P>
The structure of VSAM files, and the record insertion process may
seem very complex when compared with simpler (e.g. DOS FAT) file 
systems ... but DOS FAT files don't support keyed access or record
insertion, and are significantly slower than VSAM files even
for simple sequential reading.  Given the problems to be solved, the
VSAM mechanisms are elegantly simple.
<P>
While indexed sequential files have some unique requirements, 
almost all modern file systems are designed to mitigate the 
unique performance characteristics of movable head rotating 
magnetic media.  
VSAM was designed to ensure efficient sequential processing (large
transfers with few seeks), and is capable of delivering this even
after record insertions have increased the size of the database by 
an order of magnitude.  
Until rotating magnetic media is replaced by a new technology
with very different access time characteristics, the lessons
of VSAM will continue to be a good foundation for understanding 
almost any other file system.
<P>
The basic technique of leaving free space in each cylinder so that
related records can be inserted without introducing gratuitous head
motion is a key principle in file system design.  When Bill Joy
at UC Berkeley set out to improve the performance of UNIX file
systems, the Cylinder Clusters he introduced were very similar
in principle to VSAM's Control Areas.
