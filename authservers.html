<center><H1>Authentication Servers</H1></center>
<P>
In a large distributed systems, keeping track of information about all of the
authorized users and what each is authorized to do may be a great deal of work.  
We have discussed Public Key Certificates as a means of authenticating 
ones' self to a server that was not previously aware of us or able to 
engage us in a password dialog.  But ...
<UL>
   <li> it may not be practical to require all actors to have
   	registered public/private key pairs, or for all
	servers to use them as the basis for authentication.</li>
   <li> even if we have an authenticated identity for an actor,
   	we still may need to be able to access and interpret
	a large access control database to determine whether or
	not they are allowed to perform a particular operation.</li>
</UL>
At some point, it becomes unreasonable to expect application level
services to be able to decide who should be allowed to do what.
And we ask if Authentication and Authorization checking can be
turned into services.
</P>
<H2>Authentication and Authorization as a Service</H2>
<P>
We introduced the concept of Certificate Authorities, as trusted agents
who we trusted to authenticate Public Key Certificates ... and,
by implication, the identity of the owner of the associated
private key.  This concept of delegated trust can be applied to a
wider range of authentication and authorization decisions.
</P>
<P>
A public key certificate is one type of <em>credential</em>, which we trust
because it was signed by someone we trust.  We could use a similar
technique to get trusted <em>capabilities</em>:
<ul>
   <li> an actor would contact an authentication server, and 
   	describe the actions to be performed.</li>
   <li> the authentication server would both authenticate the
   	actor and determine whether or not that actor was
	allowed to do the proposed operations.</li>
   <li> after a successful access check, the authentication 
   	server would create a <em>work ticket</em> describing
	the actor, the permitted operation, and any other
	relevent information (e.g. "good until date"), and
	then sign it (e.g. with his private key)</li>
   <li>	the actor would present the <em>work ticket</em> to
   	the appropriate server along with the request.</li>
   <li> the server would not have to do any authentication
   	or authorization checking beyond verifying the
	validity of the work ticket.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
Such a model relieves application servers of all responsibility for
authentication and authorization checking.  It also completely 
isolates them from the particular mechanisms and policies by which
identities are authenticated and privileges ascertained.
</P>
<H2>Work Tickets</H2>
<P>
The above described <em>work tickets</em> are unforgeable, in that the
signature prevents random agents from creating work tickets.  If they
include expiration dates, they cannot be reused.  But, as described,
they are transferrable (or stealable).  A server would honor any 
request described by a valid ticket.  How can we ensure that the ticket
can only be used by the authorized agent/actor?
</p>
<P>
We could certainly include the public key of the authorized agent in 
the ticket, but this would get the server back into the authentication 
business.  Another common approach is to have the authentication server
generate a session key, and encrypt a copy for the client with the 
client's public key, and a copy for the server with the server's public
key.  In this way, each party can be confident that it is talking to
the authorized agent.
</P>
<H2>Work Tickets without Public Key Encryption</H2>
<P>
The above has been described in terms of public key encryption, but 
similar processes can be implemented with symmetric encryption. 
In Kerberos, each actor had a symmetric key which was shared only
with the authentication server.  These keys could be used:
<ol type="a">
   <li> to authenticate a ticket as having come from the authentication server</li>
   <li> to communicate information which can only be read by actors
        of the authorized agent</li>
<ol>
</P>
<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>
An authentication service can completely eliminate the need for application
servers to know about authorized actors and how to authenticate them.
Work tickets are examples of unforgeable capabilities that can eliminate
the need for applications to make authorization decisions.
Even in closed systems (where authentication and authorization checking
are not issues), work tickets are a common representation for granted leases.
