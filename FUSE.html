<H1>File systems in USEr mode</H1>

<H2> Introduction </h2>
<P>
Since the earliest Operating Systems implementations, their most fundamental
services have been:
<ul>
   <li> the creation and management of processes</li>
   <li> the creation and persistence of the data on which they operate</li>
</ul>
This second set of services included both APIs for file access, and implementations
of the file systems (generally on <em>Direct Access Storage Devices</em>) in which
they could be safely and efficiently stored.
These were originally implemented as part of the OS kernel, but it is now
possible to implement file systems in user-mode programs, making those implementations
much easier, and thereby enabling the creation of a wide range of new services.
</P>
<H2> Motivations </h2>
<P>
While file systems have traditionally been implemented as part of the
OS Kernel, it is no longer clear why this should be necessary:
<ul>
   <li>File system implementations may need to do a great deal of
       performance-critical I/O to <em>direct access</em> storage
       devices. Most operating systems now provide high performance
       asynchronous I/O services for use by user-mode programs.</li>

   <li>File systems will be asked to check and enforce authorization
       rules (for what operations a given user can perform on a given
       object).  These decisions are dependent on user authentication,
       and knowing which user is making each request.  But
       given such identification, a file system can make and enforce
       access control rules with no further use of system services.</li>

   <li>Beyond these, there is little reason that a file system implementation
       should require access to any in-kernel data or services.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
Implementing and supporting a file system (that runs within the operating 
system kernel) can be extremely difficult:
<ul>
   <li>The services (e.g. for synchronization and memory management) are
       complex and quite different from those used by user-mode processes.</li>
   <li>The tools for debugging a running OS kernel are nowhere nearly as
       convenient or powerful as those for user-mode processes.</li>
   <li>The performance and correctness requirements for kernel code are much
       stricter than those for most user-mode software, and the review processes
       to get new kernel code accepted are correspondingly much more demanding.</li>
   <li>Updating kernel software (e.g. for bug fixes or new features) may involve
       installing a new OS version and rebooting the system ... much more
       difficult than simply loading and running a new program.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
For all of these reasons, it is much simpler and easier to implement some 
file systems as user-mode programs.  Providing this capability makes it
possible for a much wider range of people to implement and distribute a much
wider range of file-system-like services.
</P>
<H2> Kernel-FUSE Integration </h2>
<P>
Most operating systems have been designed to support many alternative
file systems, allowing each file system implementation to be a plug-in
(usually dynamically loadable) module.  Each file system implementation
supports the same basic system calls (e.g. <tt>create/unlink, open/close, 
read/write, mkdir/rmdir</tt>), but uses different <em>on-disk</em>
representations for this data (e.g. EXT3, NTFS, ISO9660) or uses
remote access protocols (e.g. <tt>NFS</tt>) to forward those requests
to remote servers.
</P>
<P>
User-mode file system (<tt>FUSE</tt>) implementations can be enabled 
by another such plug-in file system implementation.  The <tt>FUSE</tt>
file system plug-in acts as a router, translating file access system 
calls into messages that will be sent to some user-mode process that
knows how to implement them.
</P>

<P>
On the other side of those messages, a new library (<em>libfuse</em>) has
been developed to:
<ul>
   <li> facilitate the registration of new file system implementations,
        and the mounting of their instances</li>
   <li> receive request messages from the kernel <tt>FUSE</tt> module</li>
   <li> translate them into subroutine calls (to a local implementation)</li>
   <li> translate the returned results back into messages to be sent bac to the kernel <tt>FUSE</tt> module,
        which will, in turn, deliver those results back to the requesting process.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<H2> FUSE Examples </h2>
<P>
Some traditional (on-disk) file systems (e.g. Windows <tt>NTFS</tt>) have
been implemented as <tt>FUSE</tt> daemons, but <tt>FUSE</tt> is more
commonly used for less-traditional services.  
<tt>FUSE</tt> wrappers have made it possible for ordinary programs to
use the standard POSIX APIs to:
<ul>
   <li>access individual files in standard containers (e.g. <tt>.tar.gz</tt> files)</li>
   <li>access remote files via a wide range of protocols (e.g. FTP, SSH, S3).</li>
   <li>read and write data in scalable, high performance, clustered file systems
       (e.g. <tt>GlusterFS</tt>, <tt>CephFS</tt>)</li>
</ul>
